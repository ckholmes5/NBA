#I want to input an algorithm and it tells me how it performs compared to a simple algorithm
#First calculate the best possible outcome. I can probably do that once in the main data pull, then have a function that updates it daily if it's not already done.

#Iterate through every day and do the lineup picks with both algorithms.
#Calculate the score for both lineups, then divide your lineup by perfect lineup.
#Average this ratio, then compare using a t-test or some shit, I don't know maybe you can just eyeball it.









#TODO
#1. Have some option where you can switch the rotoguru mode from "Finding the best lineup" to "Finding the best lineup that your algorithm predicted". This will entail subbing in DKPoints from your algorithm into the stat array setup part of the lineup picks.
